Ques1 : When would you want to create a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local ?

Ans1 : Whenever we would want to work from multiple sources, whether it be a friend or a different computer, working on cloud is better because it becomes accessible from all everywhere. If working personally, then working locally might work fine.
